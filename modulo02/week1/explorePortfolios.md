### my analysis

|  | portfolio01 | portfolio02 | portfolio03 | Which portfolio stood out to you in each category and why? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | https://www.shujdesign.com | https://www.behance.net/gallery/168903999/UXUI-Designer-Portfolio-CV-2023/modules/952808577 | https://pennybanks.com |  |
| How does the portfolio establish the designer’s personal brand? | they mention their love for simplicity, and the design of the portfolio supports that idea | with a not-so-formal aproach. being playfull and close. | the design of the portfolio demonstrate care for form, and a professional aproach and high quality look n'feel | the second one. Because the ways it's designed, makes it feel like it was altered(intervenido) by the designer. Showing her personal touch and personality. |
| Is the navigation simple and intuitive? | yes, there are basically 2 parts. The main page, and the proyect page. both are navigated the same wayand there are limited options to click into  on them. | this is a non interactive portfolio, the advantage of this is that is really eassy to  navigate for anyone, and that the user flow is almost always the same. The disadvantage is that you can't further investigate about the pryeects or the info shown. | this one is easy to navigate due to it's format, is shows 2 columns of proyects, and at the left of the screen you can go to the about page and other items aside the proyects. the only flaw I noticed is that the images of the proyects, shown in the main page, are not as good and memorable as the ones inside the proyects page.  | the third one is the most intuitive in my opinion, since everything is 1 click apart, and the "hitboxes" are well thought and implemented |
| Does the portfolio website go beyond the template? | this one is very simple and makes me think that it was a filling of the template without much personalization or iteration on the format | this designer put a lot of her own touch into this portofolio, this really gives a lot of personality to the portfolio, and makes me feel like I know this designer more that I know the other designers | i feel that this also keeps it close to the orginal template, but it demostrates a lot of atention to detail and a deep involvement with each of the proyects. | the second one. It makes me think that they used more than 1 program to design it, maybe illustrator and procreate |
| Does the portfolio website include a diversity of projects? | they include a variety of topics on the research and purpose of the proyects, but all of them are about UI design. So I'd say no. | this portfolio also has only UI proyects, but the way they are presented and approached, makes them feel really different. So I think the variety of formats makes it seem like there is more variety than there really is. | there a wide variety of proyects. The thing that draws my attention the most, is that the majority of the proyects are from the industrial design area, but they all have a UX approach, within it's reasearch and design. | in my opinion, the third one. But this may be a bias towards industrial design. Which will be my university deegree |
| Is the site housing the portfolio responsive? | yes | no | yes | the third one, mostly because of the animations shown when panning over interactive zones. |

### portfolio

a collection of work you've created that shows your skills in certain area. "you want recruiters to immediately understand who you are and your strengths as a UX designer."

es buena idea usar un creador de páginas web, muhcos de ellos con la filosofía "what you see is what you get"(wysiwyg)

ejemplifican con estos 3 sitios:
- [wix](https://www.wix.com)
- [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com)
- [webflow](https://webflow.com)

la que más me llamó la atención es webflow, porque integra algunos elementos de programación
